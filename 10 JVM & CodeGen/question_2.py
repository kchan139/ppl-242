Assume that 
    class FloatLiteral in AST is declared with field value in float type. 
    The visitor CodeGeneration has field emit keeping an object of Emitter 
    Object Frame is kept in field frame of the argument passed to parameter o of visitFloatLiteral
    The method visitFloatLiteral must return a pair of jasmin code of loading a float constant into operand stack and the type of the constant (one object of a subclass of class Type)
Based on the above assumption, write method visitFloatLiteral(self,ctx,o) of visitor CodeGeneration? Your code is at line 160.
Remind that class Type has subclasses: IntType, FloatType, VoidType, StringType.
